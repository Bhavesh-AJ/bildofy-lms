# Chapter: Electricity

## Introduction to Electricity
- **Electricity** is the flow of electric charge, primarily carried by electrons.
- It is a form of energy that can be converted into other forms such as light, heat, and mechanical energy.

## Electric Charge
- **Types of Charges**: Positive and Negative
- **Unit of Charge**: Coulomb (C)
- **Law of Charges**: Like charges repel, unlike charges attract.

## Current Electricity
- **Electric Current (I)**: The rate of flow of electric charge.
  - **Formula**: \( I = \frac{Q}{t} \)
    - Where \( Q \) is charge in coulombs and \( t \) is time in seconds.
- **Unit of Current**: Ampere (A)

### Example
- If 5 coulombs of charge flow through a conductor in 2 seconds, the current is:
  \[
  I = \frac{5 \, C}{2 \, s} = 2.5 \, A
  \]

## Voltage
- **Voltage (V)**: The electric potential difference between two points.
  - **Formula**: \( V = \frac{W}{Q} \)
    - Where \( W \) is work done in joules and \( Q \) is charge in coulombs.
- **Unit of Voltage**: Volt (V)

### Example
- If 10 joules of work is done to move 2 coulombs of charge, the voltage is:
  \[
  V = \frac{10 \, J}{2 \, C} = 5 \, V
  \]

## Resistance
- **Resistance (R)**: Opposition to the flow of current.
  - **Formula**: \( R = \frac{V}{I} \)
- **Unit of Resistance**: Ohm (Ω)

### Example
- If the voltage across a resistor is 12 volts and the current flowing is 3 amperes, the resistance is:
  \[
  R = \frac{12 \, V}{3 \, A} = 4 \, \Omega
  \]

## Ohm's Law
- States that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points.
  - **Formula**: \( V = I \times R \)

## Series and Parallel Circuits
### Series Circuit
- Components are connected end-to-end.
- **Total Resistance**: \( R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots \)
- **Current**: Same through all components.

### Parallel Circuit
- Components are connected across the same voltage source.
- **Total Resistance**: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \ldots
  \]
- **Voltage**: Same across all components.

## Power in Electrical Circuits
- **Electrical Power (P)**: The rate at which electrical energy is consumed or converted.
  - **Formula**: \( P = V \times I \)
- **Unit of Power**: Watt (W)

### Example
- If a device operates at 10 volts and draws 2 amperes of current, the power consumed is:
  \[
  P = 10 \, V \times 2 \, A = 20 \, W
  \]

## Conclusion
Electricity is a fundamental concept in physics that involves the flow of electric charge. Understanding current, voltage, resistance, and their interrelationships is crucial for analyzing electrical circuits.

# Chapter: Electricity

## Introduction
Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the flow of electric charge. It is essential in our daily lives, powering everything from household appliances to industrial machines.

## Electric Charge
- **Definition**: A property of subatomic particles that causes them to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field.
- **Types**: Positive (+) and Negative (−) charges.
- **Unit**: Coulomb (C).

### Example
- Protons carry a positive charge, while electrons carry a negative charge.

## Conductors and Insulators
- **Conductors**: Materials that allow electric charges to flow easily (e.g., metals like copper and aluminum).
- **Insulators**: Materials that do not allow electric charges to flow (e.g., rubber, glass).

## Current Electricity
- **Electric Current (I)**: The flow of electric charge through a conductor.
  - **Unit**: Ampere (A).
  - **Formula**: \( I = \frac{Q}{t} \) where \( Q \) is charge in coulombs and \( t \) is time in seconds.

### Example
- A current of 2 A means that 2 coulombs of charge pass through a point in the circuit every second.

## Voltage
- **Definition**: The electric potential difference between two points in a circuit.
- **Unit**: Volt (V).
- **Formula**: \( V = \frac{W}{Q} \) where \( W \) is work done in joules and \( Q \) is charge in coulombs.

### Example

## Series and Parallel Circuits
### Series Circuit
- Components are connected end-to-end, so the same current flows through all components.
- **Total Resistance**: \( R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots \)

### Example
- In a series circuit with three resistors of 2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 5 Ω, the total resistance is \( 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \, Ω \).

### Parallel Circuit

### Parallel Circuit
- **Definition**: Components connected across the same voltage source.
- **Total Resistance**: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots
  \]
- **Voltage**: Same across all components.

## 8. Power (P)
- **Definition**: Rate at which electrical energy is consumed or converted.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  P = VI
  \]
- **Unit**: Watt (W)
- **Example**: A device operating at 10 V with a current of 2 A consumes:
  \[
  P = 10 \, V \times 2 \, A = 20 \, W
  \]

## 9. Electrical Energy
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  E = Pt
  \]
  where \(E\) = energy (in Joules), \(P\) = power (in Watts), \(t\) = time (in seconds).
- **Example**: If a device consumes 20 W for 5 seconds, the energy used is:
  \[
  E = 20 \, W \times 5 \, s = 100 \, J
  \]

## 10. Safety Measures
- **Fuses**: Protect circuits from overload by melting and breaking the circuit.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatically interrupt the circuit when current exceeds a certain limit.

## Conclusion
Understanding electricity involves grasping concepts of charge, current, voltage, resistance, and power. Mastery of these principles is essential for practical applications in electrical circuits.

# Chapter: Electricity

## Introduction to Electricity
- **Electricity** is the flow of electric charge, primarily carried by electrons in conductors.
- **Key Concepts**: Current, Voltage, Resistance.

## Electric Current
- **Definition**: The rate of flow of electric charge.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  I = \frac{Q}{t}
  \]
  where \(I\) is current (in Amperes), \(Q\) is charge (in Coulombs), and \(t\) is time (in seconds).
- **Types of Current**:
  - **Direct Current (DC)**: Flows in one direction (e.g., batteries).
  - **Alternating Current (AC)**: Changes direction periodically (e.g., household electricity).

## Voltage
- **Definition**: The electric potential difference between two points.
- **Unit**: Volt (V).
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  V = \frac{W}{Q}
  \]
  where \(V\) is voltage, \(W\) is work done (in Joules), and \(Q\) is charge (in Coulombs).

## Resistance
- **Definition**: Opposition to the flow of electric current.
- **Unit**: Ohm (Ω).
- **Ohm's Law**: 
  \[
  V = I \times R
  \]
  where \(R\) is resistance.
- **Factors Affecting Resistance**:
  - Material: Conductors have low resistance; insulators have high resistance.
  - Length: Longer conductors have higher resistance.
  - Cross-sectional Area: Thicker conductors have lower resistance.
  - Temperature: Resistance increases with temperature for conductors.

## Series and Parallel Circuits
### Series Circuit
- **Definition**: Components connected end-to-end, sharing the same current.
- **Total Resistance**: 
  \[
  R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots
  \]
- **Current**: Same through all components.
- **Voltage**: Divided among components.

### Parallel Circuit
- **Definition**: Components connected across the same voltage source.
- **Total Resistance**: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \ldots
  \]
- **Current**: Divided among branches.
- **Voltage**: Same across all components.

## Power in Electrical Circuits
- **Definition**: The rate at which electrical energy is consumed or converted.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  P = V \times I
  \]
  where \(P\) is power (in Watts), \(V\) is voltage, and \(I\) is current.
- **Alternate Formula**: 
  \[
  P = I^2 \times R
  \]
  or 
  \[
  P = \frac{V^2}{R}
  \]

## Applications of Electricity
- **Household Appliances**: Lights, fans, refrigerators.
- **Industrial Uses**: Motors, transformers.
- **Communication**: Telephones, radios.

## Safety Measures
- **Fuses**: Protect circuits from overload by melting and breaking the circuit.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatically interrupt the circuit when current exceeds a safe level.
- **Earthing**: Prevents electric shock by providing a safe path for excess current.

## Conclusion
Understanding electricity is crucial for both practical applications and safety. Mastery of concepts like current, voltage, resistance, and circuit configurations is essential for solving problems in this field.
